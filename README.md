# ðŸ“¸ Intelligent Face Tracking Camera â€” Phase 1

This project simulates an intelligent camera system that keeps a speakerâ€™s face centered in the frame as they move. In **Phase 1**, we use a laptop webcam and OpenCV to detect and track a face in real time, displaying movement direction and estimated speed.
